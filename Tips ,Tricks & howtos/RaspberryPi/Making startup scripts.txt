I'm not actually ssh'd into a raspberry pi right now, but basisically you make a bash script in the home folder, then you go to /etc/systemd/system/ , make a script in there (google 'systemd run bash script') and then do 'sudo systemctl start (file name that you just wrote in that directory)' to test it, AND ONCE IT WORKS(IT GIVES YOU CONTROL OVER THE COMMAND PROMPT 1-2 SECONDS AFTER RUNNING THAT COMMAND WITHOUT CONTROL+C), use 'systemctl enable (file name)' to make it run on startup.
